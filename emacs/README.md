# Emacs Configuration

**Update: I'll mark this as inactive as I only use Emacs keybinding in terminal now...**

Just my personal Emacs configuration file for fast environment setup across different systems.

Thanks Kyle Purdon for this awesome initial configuration file provided [here](https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/).
